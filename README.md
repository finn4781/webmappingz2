# Web mapping Z-1

This is a static website with an interactive map embedded. This site has about, contact, privacy, terms, and main pages. The main page is a Mapbox map that contains fake points, each with a popup that shows short information. When you click on a point, an off-canvas is opened, showing more information about the point. It also has a button to filter what points to see based on color.
